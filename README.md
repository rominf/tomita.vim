Vim files for working on [Tomita parser](https://github.com/yandex/tomita-parser)
=================================================================================

To install Tomita parser highlighting use standard Vim methods.

If you haven't installed any Vim highlighting yet, I recommend you to look on [Vundle (vim plugin installer)](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle). Just follow the [Vundle Quick Start](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim#quick-start). You don't have to install all those plugins to make syntax highlighting work, you just need two plugins:
```
Plugin 'gmarik/Vundle.vim'
Plugin 'rominf/tomita.vim'
```

What is not highlighted
-----------------------
1. Non terminals.
